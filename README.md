# RL4Ising (Reinforcement Learning for Ising Models): Datasets and Benchmark
Reinforcement Learning for Ising Models is an open-source dataset and benchmark suite for Ising models. Our goal is to curate a public dataset of Ising models, provide a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms alongside an industry-standard solver baseline, and offer detailed tutorials for each reinforcement learning algorithm. 

Our website featuring the benchmark suite and tutorials is at [rl4ising-docs.readthedocs.io](https://rl4ising-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). <br>
Our dataset of Ising models is at [huggingface]()

## Datasets
We curate a diverse set of over 170,000 Ising models and construct two datasets:

- Dataset 1: Classify Ising models based on spin interactions
- Dataset 2: Classify Ising models based on diminsion

### Dataset 1

| Types of Ising Models | Description | Spin Range | Coupling Range |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Spin Glass            | ...         | 0 - 0      | 0 - 0          | 
| Ferromagnetic         | ...         | 0 - 0      | 0 - 0          | 
| Anti-Ferromagnetic    | ...         | 0 - 0      | 0 - 0          | 

### Dataset 2

| Types of Ising Models | Description | Spin Range | Coupling Range |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1D ising Models       | ...         | 0 - 0      | 0 - 0          | 
| 2D ising Models       | ...         | 0 - 0      | 0 - 0          | 
| 3D ising Models       | ...         | 0 - 0      | 0 - 0          | 
| 4D ising Models       | ...         | 0 - 0      | 0 - 0          |
