Classification of Ising Models
===================================

Spin Glass Ising Model
===============================
Spin glass systems are characterized by disorder and frustration. These models are difficult to optimize due to their intricate energy landscapes, making them ideal benchmarks for advanced optimization algorithms such as reinforcement learning, quantum annealing, and simulated annealing.

Spin Ice Ising Model
==============================
Inspired by the arrangement of protons in ice, spin ice models mimic "ice rules" in spin configurations, leading to emergent quasiparticle behavior and exotic magnetic monopole excitations. These models are of great interest in condensed matter physics and have recently gained traction in programmable quantum simulators and artificial materials.

Ferromagnetic Ising Model
===========================
These instances represent one of the simplest yet most fundamental systems in statistical mechanics. In ferromagnetic configurations, all spins prefer to align in the same direction, minimizing the system's energy. They exhibit critical behavior such as phase transitions and are widely used in benchmarking due to their well-understood structure.

Anti-Ferromagnetic Ising Model
==============================
Conversely to ferromagnetic models, the spins of anti-ferromagnetic configurations prefer to anti-align to minimize the energy.
