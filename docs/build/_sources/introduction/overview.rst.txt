Overview
============================================

Reinforcement Learning for Ising Models is an open-source dataset and benchmark suite for Ising models. Our goal is to curate a public dataset of Ising models, 
provide a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms alongside an industry-standard solver baseline, and offer detailed tutorials
for each reinforcement learning algorithm.
