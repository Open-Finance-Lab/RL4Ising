==============================================================================================
Welcome to `Reinforcement Learning for Ising Model <https://github.com/YangletLiu/RL4Ising>`_!
==============================================================================================

`Reinforcement Learning for Ising Model <https://github.com/YangletLiu/RL4Ising>`_ is an open-source dataset of Ising models and benchmark of SOTA ground state Reinforcement Learning methods. 
Our goal is to document the progress of current and future RL methods at searching for the ground state of Ising model in different scale, dimensionality, and Ising model classifications

Reinforcement Learning for Ising model provides a **collective dataset**, **solver baseline**, **SOTA RL tutorials**, and **RL benchmark** :

   - **Collective Dataset**: Over 190,000 synthetic or real Ising model instances spanning 3 classifications.
   - **Solver Baseline**: Industry-level commerical and open-source MIP solvers
   - **SOTA RL Tutorials**: ...
   - **RL Benchmark**: ...
