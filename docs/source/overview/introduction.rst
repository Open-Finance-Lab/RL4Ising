Welcome to `RL4Ising <https://github.com/YangletLiu/RL4Ising>`_!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RL4Ising or Reinforcement Learning for Ising Model is an open-source dataset and benchmark suite for Ising models. We aim  
curate a public dataset of Ising models, provide a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art reinforcement learning 
algorithms alongside an industry-standard solver baseline, and offer detailed tutorials for key reinforcement learning 
algorithms.

Through the open-source dataset and benchmark RL4Ising offers a **diverse** set of Ising model instances, ease of **reproducibility**, and 
strong **performace evaulation**:

- **Diversity**: RL4Ising provides over 170,000 Ising instances spanning different lattice types, 1 to 4 dimensions, spin interactions.
- **Reproducibility**: 
- **Performace Evaulation**:
