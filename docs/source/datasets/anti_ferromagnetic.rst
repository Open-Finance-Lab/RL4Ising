Description of Ising Model Type
===============================

In an anti-ferromagnetic Ising model, neighboring spins want to anti-align. In other words, they want to point in the opposite directions to minimize the system's energy.
The energy Hamiltonian of this model can be given by

.. math::
    E = -J \sum_{i<j}s_i s_j

If the neighboring spins point in the same direction, the energy of the system will increase and, conversely arranged, will decrease. 

Instances
=========

The instances we are providing for the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model type consist of weighted edges. Note that there are only negative weights present for these instances. The complexity of an instance is determined by its size (# of nodes).

This paper demonstrates that an RL agent is able to surpass the performance of standard heuristic temperature schedule for two classes of Hamiltonians. They show the performance of their implementation by training on weak-strong clusters (bipartite graph with two fully connected clusters) and nearest-neighbor square spin glasses.
