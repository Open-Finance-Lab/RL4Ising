    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to classical simulated annealing, learning-based methods offer several practical advantages when applied to large-scale NP-hard optimization problems. Simulated annealing relies on fixed, hand-designed components such as neighborhood moves and temperature schedules, which remain unchanged across different problem instances. In contrast, learning-based methods can adapt the search strategy by extracting patterns from data or repeated search experience, allowing the heuristic to better align with the underlying structure of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, while simulated annealing treats each run independently, learning-based approaches can amortize computational cost across multiple instances by reusing learned knowledge, enabling faster generation of high-quality candidate solutions at inference time. This shift from instance-specific random exploration to experience-driven guidance is particularly beneficial in complex energy landscapes, where naive random walks may suffer from slow exploration and high computational cost. Importantly, learning-based methods do not remove randomness or circumvent the NP-hard nature of the problem, but they can significantly improve practical efficiency by guiding randomized search toward more promising regions of the solution space."

    "\n",
    "Simulated annealing solves optimization problems by approximately sampling a sequence of Boltzmann distributions, but its effectiveness is often limited by slow sampling dynamics in rugged or glassy energy landscapes. In practical, finite-time runs, the system deviates from equilibrium, leading to suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational Neural Annealing addresses this limitation by replacing the exact Boltzmann distribution with a flexible, parameterized model that can be efficiently sampled. Instead of annealing the physical system itself, VNA anneals a learnable probability distribution whose parameters are optimized using variational principles and energy feedback. Modern autoregressive neural networks provide an ideal parameterization, as they allow exact and fast sampling even when representing complex, highly structured landscapes. This shift from trajectory-based sampling to distribution-based learning enables more efficient exploration of low-energy configurations under limited computational budgets."
